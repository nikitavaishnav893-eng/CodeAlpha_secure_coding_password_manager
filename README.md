and protects user credentials using encryption techniques.



 Features
- Secure user registration with hashed passwords
- Secure login authentication using bcrypt
- GUI-based interface using Tkinter
- Password storage with masked display
- Input validation and access control
- Demonstrates secure coding best practices


 Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Tkinter (GUI)
- bcrypt (Password Hashing)
